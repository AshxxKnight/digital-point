Digital Point is a printer store that trades in printers and its accessories including, toners, cartridge and ink. Since digitalisation has become a very important tool for businesses and enterprises a website is constructed for the company.

Project Description :

 This website is constructed keeping in mind the requirements of the admin or the company proprietors. The visitors are presented the front end of the website which they can explore without logging in. For any further activities the users must first register them as a company customer. As in current version the users have to register themselves as customers, in future updates the website would automatically create the user account when they make a purchase. After logging in the users can put up toner request and complaints (if any). Similarly, the admin has been given a login access, using which he/she can log in to the website and can see the list of registered users, placed orders and complaints.
